                        I have prepared and participated in the creation of plans and programs, approved by the MINEDUC, which are being implemented in various educational establishments throughout the country.

            <p>
                Many adults feel the need to learn or improve their English level in their careers.
                I have helped adults to improve their conversation level and technical vocabulary in engineering, military, pharmaceutical concepts

                <h4 class="question"> Preparation for standarized tests  </h4>
            <p>
                Many students who wish to apply to foreign programs need to pass some standarized English tests. This tests meassure their English skills with a variety of intentions.
                For example, TOEIC measures your ability to work in English while the TOEFL measures your ability to take university courses in English.
                I'm familiar with how this tests are built and I can help you prepare for them. I can identifying the area where you most need help, wheter is speaking, writing, listening comprehension, etc
